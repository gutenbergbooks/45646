<h2>LORD ROSEBERY IN THE NORTH.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Prime Minister</span> has
been having a high old time
of it lately in the North, and
has become the "youngest
burgess" of goodness knows
how many ancient boroughs.
But it has been left to a
reporter to note with an eagle
eye the really interesting performance
which Lord <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>
has put to his credit.
"Immediately on leaving
Dornoch," says this gentleman
(the reporter, not the
<span class="smcap">Premier</span>), "Lord <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>
and the Duke of <span class="smcap">Sutherland</span>
drove to the Meikle Ferry, a
distance of four miles, crossed
the ferry, and again drove to
Tain, four miles farther on.
Crossing the ferry they both
took a turn at the oars, and
<i>generally discussed the sport
of seal shooting</i>!" This suggests
quite a fresh phase of the
New Journalism. We shall
soon read such paragraphs as
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir <span class="smcap">William Harcourt</span>
left town for Malwood on
Tuesday. Going down in the
train the right hon. gentleman
played marbles with a
fellow-passenger, and discussed
generally the virtues
of resignation."</p>

<p>"Mr. H. H. <span class="smcap">Fowler</span> transacted
important business at
the India Office yesterday.
He and his private secretary
played a game of trundling
hoops, and had an animated
talk on the subject of whist."</p>

<p>"Mr. A. J. <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> played
at golf with a gentleman, with
whom he had a very interesting
conversation on the sport
of chute shooting."</p>

<hr />

<p>The moral of which would
seem to be that, since even
conversation is now reported,
silence is more golden than
ever; though <i>Mr. Punch</i>
notices that the <span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span>
showed rare diplomacy
in his choice of a subject.
Not even a reporter could extract
any political meaning out
of the sport of seal shooting!</p>

Manxman</i>, and the novelist has been telling the <i>Record</i> to remember its
Rubrics. "Mr. <span class="smcap">Caine</span>," says the <i>Record</i>, "has been in a hurry." The
<i>Record</i> lost a chance, as, evidently expecting a storm of fury, it
should have deprecated the author's anger by saying, "Don't be in a
hurry-<span class="smcap">Caine</span>."</p>

He's coming in along
with us to 'ear what
you say, if you've no
objections.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I
must make a friend of
this coachman, or else
&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Aloud.</i>) I shall
be charmed, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Checkley</span>. I've only
a very few minutes to
spare; but I'm most
curious to see this horse
of yours.</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> He ain't
one o' <i>my</i> 'orses, Sir.
If he <i>'ad</i> been&mdash;&mdash;But
there, I'd better say
nothing about it.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>as he leads
the way into the stables,
and turns up the gas</i>).
There, Sir, that's <i>Deerfoot</i>
over there in the
loose box.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>).
He seems to me much
like any <i>other</i> horse!
However, I can't be
wrong in admiring.
(<i>Aloud, as he inspects
him through the rails.</i>)
Ah, indeed? he <i>is</i> worth
seeing! A magnificent
creature!</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>stripping off</i>
Deerfoot's <i>clothing</i>).
He's a good 'orse, Sir.
Her ladyship won't
trust herself on no
other animal, not since
she 'ad the influenzy so
bad. She'd take on
dreadful if I 'ad to tell
her he wouldn't be fit for no more work, she would!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>sympathetically</i>). I can quite imagine so. Not that he seems
in any danger of <i>that</i>!</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> (<i>triumphantly</i>). There, you 'ear that, <span class="smcap">Adams</span>? The
minute he set eyes on the 'orse!</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> Wait till Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> has seen him move a bit, and
see what he says <i>then</i>.</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> If it was what <i>you</i> think, he'd never be standing like he
is now, depend upon it.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> You <i>can't</i> depend upon it. He 'eard us coming, and
he's quite artful enough to draw his foot back for fear o' getting a
knock. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.) I've noticed him very fidgety-like on
his forelegs this last day or two.</p>

<p><i>Und. Have</i> you, though? (<i>To himself.</i>) I hope he won't be
fidgety with his <i>hind</i>-legs. I shall stay outside.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> I cooled him down with a rubub and aloes ball, and kep
'im on low diet; but he don't seem no better.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I didn't gather the horse was unwell. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Dear me! no better? You don't say so!</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> If you'd rubbed a little embrocation into the shoulder,
you'd ha' done more good, in <i>my</i> opinion, and it's my belief as Mr.
<span class="smcap">Undershell</span> here will tell you I'm right.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Can't afford to offend the coachman! (<i>Aloud.]</i>)
Well, I daresay&mdash;er&mdash;embrocation <i>would</i> have been better.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> Ah, that's where me and Mr. <span class="smcap">Checkley</span> differ. According
to me, it ain't to do with the shoulder at all&mdash;it's a deal lower
down.... I'll 'ave him out of the box and you'll soon see what I
mean.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Pray don't trouble on my account. I&mdash;I can see
him capitally from where I am, thanks.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> You know best, Sir. Only I thought you'd be better able
to form a judgment after you'd seen the way he stepped across.
But if you was to come in and examine the frog?&mdash;&mdash;I don't like the
look of it myself.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I'm sure <i>I</i> don't. I've a horror of reptiles.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) You're very good. I&mdash;I think I won't come in. The place
must be rather <i>damp</i>, mustn't it&mdash;for that?</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> It's dry enough in 'ere, Sir, as you may see; nor yet he
ain't been standing about in no wet. Still, there it <i>is</i>, you see!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>).
What a fool he must be
not to drive it out! Of
course it must annoy
the horse. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I
don't see it; but I'm
quite willing to take
your word for it.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> I don't know
how you can <i>expect</i> to
see it, Sir, without you
look inside of the 'oof
for it.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>).
It's not alive&mdash;it's
something <i>inside</i> the
hoof. I suppose I ought
to have known that.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Just so; but
I see no necessity for
looking inside the hoof.</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> In course he
don't, or he'd ha' looked
the very fust thing,
with all his experience.
I 'ope you're satisfied
<i>now</i>, <span class="smcap">Adams</span>?</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> I can't say
as I am. I say as no
man can examine a
'orse thoroughly at that
distance, be he who he
may. And whether I'm
right or wrong, it 'ud
be more of a satisfaction
to me if Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>
was to step in and
see the 'oof for himself.</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> Well, there's
sense in that, and I
dessay Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>
won't object to obliging
you that far.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>with reluctance</i>).
Oh, with pleasure,
if you make a
point of it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He enters the loose box delicately.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>picking up one of the horse's feet</i>). Now, tell me how
this 'ere 'oof strikes you.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). That hoof can't; but I'm not so sure about
the others. (<i>Aloud, as he inspects it.</i>) Well&mdash;er&mdash;it seems to me a
very <i>nice</i> hoof.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>grimly</i>). I was not arsking your opinion of it as a work of
<i>Art</i>, Sir. Do you see any narrering coming on, or do you not?
That's what I should like to get out of <i>you</i>!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Does this man suppose I <i>collect</i> hoofs! However,
I'm not going to commit myself. (<i>Aloud.</i>) H'm&mdash;well, I&mdash;I
rather agree with Mr. <span class="smcap">Checkley</span>.</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> I knew he would! Now you've <i>got</i> it, <span class="smcap">Adams</span>! <i>I</i> can
see Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> knows what he's about.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>persistently</i>). But look at this 'ere pastern. You can't
deny there's puffiness there. How do you get over <i>that</i>?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> If the horse is puffy, it's <i>his</i> business to get over it&mdash;not mine.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>aggrieved</i>). You may think proper to treat it light, Sir;
but if you put your 'and down 'ere, above the coronet, you'll feel a
throbbing as plain as&mdash;&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Very likely. But I don't know, really, that it would afford
me any particular gratification if I <i>did</i>!</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> Well, if you don't take <i>my</i> view, I should ha' thought as
you'd want to feel the 'orse's pulse.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> You are quite mistaken. I don't. (<i>To himself.</i>) Particularly
as I shouldn't know where to find it. What a bore this fellow
is with his horse!</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> In course, Sir, <i>you</i> see what's running in Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams'</span> 'ed
all this time, what he's a-driving at, eh?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I only wish I did! This will require tact.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I could hardly avoid seeing <i>that</i>&mdash;could I?</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> I should think not. And it stands to reason as a vet like
yourself'd spot a thing like navickler fust go off.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). A vet! They've been taking me for a vet all
this time! I can't have been so ignorant as I thought. I really
don't like to undeceive them&mdash;they might feel annoyed. (<i>Aloud,
knowingly.</i>) To be sure, I&mdash;I spotted it at once.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> He <i>does</i> make it out navicular after all! What did I tell
you, <span class="smcap">Checkley</span>? Now p'r'aps you'll believe <i>me</i>!</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> I'll be shot if that 'orse has navickler, whoever says so&mdash;there!</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). It's the 'orse'll 'ave to be shot; worse luck!
I'd ha' give something if Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> could ha' shown I was
wrong; but there was very little doubt in <i>my</i> mind what it was all
along.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself, horrified</i>). I've been pronouncing this unhappy
animal's doom without knowing it! I must tone it down. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
No&mdash;no, I never said he must be shot. There's no reason to despair.
It&mdash;it's quite a mild form of er&mdash;clavicular&mdash;not at all infectious at
present. And the horse has a splendid constitution. I&mdash;I really
think he'll soon be himself again, if we only&mdash;er&mdash;leave Nature to do
her work, you know.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>after a prolonged whistle</i>). Well, if Nature ain't better
up in her work than you seem to be, it's 'igh time she chucked it,
and took to something else. You've a lot to learn about navicular,
<i>you</i> 'ave, if you can talk such rot as that!</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> Ah, I've 'ad to do with a vet or two in my time, but I'm
blest if I ever come across the likes o' <i>you</i> afore!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I <i>knew</i> they'd find me out! I must pacify
them. (<i>Aloud.</i>) But, look here, I'm <i>not</i> a vet. I never said I <i>was</i>.
It was your mistake entirely. The fact is, my&mdash;my good men, I
came down here because&mdash;well, it's unnecessary to explain now <i>why</i>
I came. But I'm most anxious to get away, and if you, my dear Mr.
<span class="smcap">Checkley</span>, could let me have a trap to take me to Shuntingbridge
to-night, I should feel extremely obliged.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Checkley</span> <i>stares, deprived of speech.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>with a private wink to</i> <span class="smcap">Checkley</span>). Certainly he will,
Sir. I'm sure <span class="smcap">Checkley</span>'ll feel proud to turn out, late as it is,
to oblige a gentleman with your remarkable knowledge of 'orse-flesh.
Drive you over hisself in the broom and pair, <i>I</i> shouldn't
wonder!</p>

<p><i>Und. One</i> horse will be quite sufficient. Very well, then. I'll just
run up and get my portmanteau, and&mdash;and one or two things of mine,
and if you will be round at the back entrance&mdash;don't trouble to drive
up to the <i>front</i> door&mdash;as soon as possible, I won't keep you waiting
longer than I can help. Good evening, Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>, and many
thanks. (<i>To himself, as he hurries back to the house.</i>) I've got
out of that rather well. Now, I've only to find my way to the
Verney Chamber, see this fellow <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, and get my clothes
back, and then I can retreat with comfort, and even dignity! These
<span class="smcap">Culverins</span> shall learn that there is at least <i>one</i> poet who will not put
up with their insolent patronage!</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adams</span>). He <i>has</i> got a cool cheek, and no mistake!
But if he waits to be druv over to Shuntingbridge till <i>I</i> come round
for him, he'll 'ave to set on that portmanteau of his a goodish
time!</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> He did you pretty brown, I must say. To 'ear you crowing
over me when he was on your side. I could 'ardly keep from
larfing!</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> I see he warn't no vet long afore you, but I let it go on for
the joke of it. It was rich to see you a wanting him to feel the 'oof,
and give it out navickler. Well, you got his opinion for what it was
wuth, so <i>you</i>'re all right!</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> You think nobody knows anything about 'orses but yourself,
you do; but if you're meanin' to make a story out o' this
against me, why, I shall tell it <i>my</i> way, that's all!</p>

<p><i>Check.</i> It was you he made a fool of, not me&mdash;and I can prove it&mdash;there!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>They dispute the point, with rising warmth, for some time.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>calming down</i>). Well, see 'ere, <span class="smcap">Checkley</span>, I dunno, come
to think of it, as either on us'll show up partickler smart over this
'ere job; and it strikes me we'd better both agree to keep quiet
about it, eh? (<span class="smcap">Checkley</span> <i>acquiesces, not unwillingly</i>.) And I think
I'll take a look in at the 'Ousekeeper's Room presently, and try if
I can't drop a hint to old <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span> about that smooth-tongued
chap, for it's my belief he ain't down 'ere for no good!</p>

<p>"Aha!" quoth the Baron. "This book of Master <span class="smcap">Stanley
Weyman's</span>, called <i>Under the Red Robe</i>, delighteth me much. A
stirring story of swashbucklers, pistols, daggers, conspirators, gay
gallants, and gentle dames! Exciting
from first to last, and all in one volume,
which, beshrew me, by my hilts!"
quoth the Baron, "the reader, be he
who he may, will find easy to take up,
and most difficult to put down, until
quite finished. 'Tis published by one
<span class="smcap">Methuen</span>, of London, whose house
Cavalier <span class="smcap">Weyman</span> hath favoured more
than once ere he wrote this stirring
romance." Towards the finish there is
a spice of <span class="smcap">Bulwer Lytton's</span> drama
<i>Richelieu</i>,&mdash;indeed the last situation
in this tale is almost one with the
action of the scene in the play where
<i>Richelieu</i> brings the lovers together.
Yet is this but a mere detail, and those
who follow the Baron's literary tips will
do well and wisely to read <i>Under the Red
Robe</i>. By the way, Mr. <span class="smcap">Caton Woodville's</span> illustrations to the story
are excellent, having the rare merit of assisting the action without
revealing the plot. "<span class="smcap">Caton</span>, thou pictureth well."</p>

<p>Within the limits of a hundred pages Lord <span class="smcap">Dufferin</span> has given
the world a picture it will not willingly let die. It is a portrait of
his mother, "one of the sweetest, most beautiful, most accomplished,
wittiest, most loving and lovable human beings that ever walked
upon the earth." This, as my Baronite says, is the superlative of
praise, and it might reasonably be suspected that filial feeling has
warped critical acumen. But here in this volume of <i>Songs, Poems,
and Verses</i> (<span class="smcap">John Murray</span>) we have Lady <span class="smcap">Dufferin</span> though dead
yet speaking, and may judge for ourselves. It is characteristic of
her son that, whilst on the first page the above title is boldly set
forth in large ruddy-hued type, a smaller line lower down, in
plain black ink, refers to the "Memoir." In its felicity of literary
style, its clear touches of characterisation, and its flashes of quiet
humour, this monograph is a masterpiece. It fittingly frames
the extract from the journal commenced by Lady <span class="smcap">Dufferin</span> when
she felt the hand of death gripping her. This fragment is prose
worthy of the author of <i>The Irish Emigrant</i>, whose simple pathos
has stirred the heart on both sides of the Atlantic. Within the
brief limits he has assigned to himself, Lord <span class="smcap">Dufferin</span> manages
to give a succinct account of the illustrious family of which <span class="smcap">Helen</span>,
Lady <span class="smcap">Dufferin</span>, was a bright, particular star. It would be difficult
to parallel the sustained brilliancy of the <span class="smcap">Sheridans</span>, from <span class="smcap">Richard
Brinsley</span> down to his great-great-grandson, at present Her
<span class="smcap">Majesty's</span> Minister at Paris. To the possession of all the graces
they have added display of all the talents. It is hard to live up to
the literary standard of the <span class="smcap">Sheridans</span>. In this delightful volume
Lord <span class="smcap">Dufferin</span> shows that the marvel was accomplished by his
mother, and is possible for himself.</p>

<p>My Baronite has made an attempt to read <i>Lourdes</i> in the convenient
shape in which Messrs. <span class="smcap">Chatto and Windus</span> present it to
the English-speaking public. He honestly admits that, finding
on a rapid glance through its pages the first chapter was a fair
sample of the bulk, he gave it up. M. <span class="smcap">Zola</span> has avowedly set himself
the task of minutely describing the pitiful experience of the halt,
the lame, the blind, and much worse, who journey to Lourdes in the
desperate hope of miraculous recovery. He may at least be congratulated
on having achieved his object. Only, the report with all
its horrible detail would more fittingly have appeared in the pages of
the <i>Lancet</i> or the <i>British Medical Journal</i>. Since it has been published
in book form realism should have been carried one step
further. The volume ought to have been bound in a poultice instead
of ordinary cloth. As it is, the leaves turned over fill the room with
faint, sickening smell of the hospital ward. <i>Lourdes</i> is certainly not
alluring. It is, in truth, <i>lourd&mdash;et sale aussi</i>.</p>

<h2>THE NEW MAN.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Fragment from the Romance of the Near Future.</i>)</p>

<p>He had waited up until two in the morning. He had watched the
hands of the clock as they passed round the face from hour to hour.
He had put a cloth over the supper, knowing, however, that the
meat would be disregarded, and only the brandy and soda-water
touched by the expected one. The poor man gazed sadly at the
children's toys, the tradesmen's books that were beside him.</p>

<p>"Not home yet," he murmured. "Ah, those dinners at the club!"</p>

<p>Then he considered his past life. He remembered his wedding-day,
when it seemed so bright and fair. He was a happy husband,
with every prospect of a long life of wedded bliss. He loved and
respected his wife, and felt that side by side they could travel along
the road of existence without a rock to arrest their progress, without
a discordant note to spoil the harmony of their song, until that song
had ceased its music in the hush of silence. Tears, suppressed until
now, flooded his eyes as he remembered the waning of the honeymoon.
He recollected the anxiety of <span class="smcap">Alice</span> to get back to town, to
be off into the City. Of course he could not follow his wife into her
business haunts; it would be immodest&mdash;nay, even improper. Still,
he had been treated kindly, in a rough, condescending sort of way.
He had had a Brougham, and had been allowed to visit his gentlemen
friends. He had plenty of chats, and occasionally <span class="smcap">Alice</span> had
accompanied him round the park. Then he had seen a good deal
of his children. His daughter, however, had now gone to school, and
his sons were always with their nursery tutor. The clock struck
once again. "Three, and not home yet!"</p>

<p>Early morning was breaking. The poor man, pale and careworn,
re-arranged his necktie, and putting on an extra overcoat, prepared
once more to resume the reading of a novel that had been attracting
his attention earlier in the evening. It was called "<i>Bobby</i>," and
related the adventures of a wild, thoughtless man, who was setting
the laws of society at open defiance.</p>

<p>"How can men write of men like this?" he murmured. "I am
not surprised that women think badly of us when we thus paint ourselves.
Visiting a music-hall with his female cousin! Going to
the Zoological Gardens unattended! Oh, <span class="smcap">Bobby</span>, <span class="smcap">Bobby</span>, what a
creation!" Then he started. There was a noise at the street-door,
and the sound of scraping on the outside as if a latch-key were vainly
seeking the key-hole. Then the portal slowly opened and a cloaked
figure lurched rather than walked in.</p>

<p>"Oh <span class="smcap">Alice</span>!" cried the frightened husband, wringing his hands
in dismay. "Is there anything the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, absolutely nothing," was the indistinct reply. "Fact is
I don't think the salmon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then the new-comer entered the dining-room, and there was
the sound of the effervescence of soda-water.</p>

<p>The poor husband sighed, mournfully turned off the gas, and went
quietly to bed.</p>

<p>"Oh wife," murmured the aggrieved husband, as he mounted the
stairs, "you cannot help bringing woe to man, for unless you did
so you would not be a woe-man."</p>

<p>And bursting into tears at this sad pleasantry, the poor chap
disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<h2>COINCIDENCE'S LONG ARM.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;May I draw your attention to a series of domestic
occurrences which illustrate the distressing and increasing tendency
of this <i>fin-de-siècle</i> age? I say <i>fin-de-siècle</i> because as it has got to
come in somehow, it may as well be said at once. At breakfast yesterday
the bacon was wretchedly cooked. My wife said, "It's the
fault of the New Cook," which was all the satisfaction or explanation
that I got. I found my study disguised in an apparent tidiness,
achieved at the cost of a complete confusion of my papers, which had
been tidied away in a manner that completely defied detection. My
wife only answered, "Oh, it's that New Housemaid." That night
we went to the theatre. The name of the play was <i>The New Woman</i>.
Then I understood the true inwardness of all my previous experiences.
The moral is so clear that I do not propose to draw any.</p>

<h2>LETTERS FROM A DÉBUTANTE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Marjorie</span>,&mdash;It is really quite time you gave me some
more of your valuable advice. Thanks to you, I was not such an
utter failure in my first season as I expected. After a month at
home (my people <i>loathe</i> the new way I do my hair, and it seemed, I
am ashamed to say, a <i>little</i> dull there), I have come to stay again
with the <span class="smcap">Lyon Taymers</span> at their country house.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
  <a href="images/168a.png">
  <img src="images/168a.png"
  alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>You remember I refused the man who
did conjuring tricks? He has written to
me since to say he sees now how right I
was&mdash;rather crushing! I also fully <i>intended</i>
to refuse Captain <span class="smcap">Mashington</span>.
But he went to Dinard without giving me
the opportunity, and I hear he has been
playing tennis there the <i>whole</i> day with
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lorne Hopper</span>. I am sure I hope
he enjoyed it. She is what you or I would
consider rather old, but is said to be perfectly
charming, and of course looks
fifteen years younger than her youngest
daughter.</p>

<p>It seems rather strange, doesn't it,
<span class="smcap">Marjorie</span>, that after being so wonderfully
sensible all the season, I should suddenly
do something quite idiotic in September?
However, I <i>have</i>; and I want you to help
me out of it. I'll tell you <i>all</i>, if you'll
promise not to laugh. When I first came, I was "thrown," as people
say, a good deal with the <span class="smcap">Taymer's</span> nephew&mdash;<span class="smcap">Oriel Crampton</span> who
has just left Oxford. I was told he was very serious, rather shy,
philanthropic, and has "views"; also that he had done a great deal
of good in the West End. This interested me, and I tried to draw
him out. They had omitted to mention that he was dreadfully susceptible.
We talked for <i>hours</i> in the garden, nearly all the time&mdash;at
first&mdash;about the housing of the rich and horrible cases of over-crowding&mdash;at
London parties. He was very earnest and ascetic (he
never drinks anything but hot water, and doesn't smoke); he lent me
books&mdash;he is rather handsome&mdash;and&mdash;gradually&mdash;somehow I found I
had drifted into an absurd sort of private half-engagement! Yes&mdash;I
have actually a bangle <i>rivetted on</i>&mdash;with a date inside&mdash;the date I
was insane enough to agree&mdash;&mdash;Isn't it dreadful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oriel</span> will be well off, but he intends to spend all his money on
founding model slums, where the people are to be teetotallers and do
bootmaking or something, and be a happy little colony. <span class="smcap">Oriel's</span>
views may necessitate his doing a little cobbling himself&mdash;just to set
an example. I was enormously impressed by this at first; but I am
afraid I have become frivolous again. Some other people have come
here, including a nice boy they call <span class="smcap">Baby Beaumont</span>. He is
really almost nineteen, but wonderfully well preserved, very clever,
and so cynical that he is quite an optimist. Almost directly, he
asked me how long I had known <span class="smcap">Oriel Crampton</span>. I said about a
fortnight. "Ah! then you must be engaged to him. Poor old
<span class="smcap">Oriel</span>! He's really quite extraordinarily old-fashioned."</p>

<p>"How old is he?" I asked, in faltering tones.</p>

<p>"He has rather a way of pretending to be young, I fancy. But he
must be four-and-twenty if he is a day. You need not say I told you."</p>

<p>It's evidently the fashion to be <i>very young</i>&mdash;for men, at least.
Sometimes I wish it were the fashion to be old enough to know
better. If <span class="smcap">Oriel</span> really <i>has</i> been engaged before, and may be again,
and if getting engaged to people is only a sort of habit of his, perhaps
he would not mind so very much if I were to break it off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Beaumont</span> is (he says himself) "frankly Pagan." He
thinks <span class="smcap">Oriel</span> too serious for me, and advises me to marry at leisure,
as I am quite sure, anyhow, to repent in haste. He wanted to send
a paragraph to the <i>Post</i> to say "A marriage has been arranged, and
will shortly be broken off, between Mr. <span class="smcap">Oriel Crampton</span> and Miss
<span class="smcap">Gladys Mayfield</span>, younger daughter," and so on.</p>

<p>Last night, when we were playing games, <span class="smcap">Oriel</span> went out while we
thought of a word, and he got quite angry with me because I had said
the moon was "vegetable" and <i>he</i> said it was "mineral." He may
be right, or he may not&mdash;I daresay he is&mdash;but still he need not be
touchy, and refuse to play any more, and sulk all the evening.</p>

<p>I am afraid I should not be happy with him. He collects postage
stamps, too, which depresses me dreadfully.</p>

<p><i>Please</i> write and tell me what to do&mdash;or rather, how to do it. Can
one get a bangle <i>rivetted off</i>?... I have just heard that the <span class="smcap">Lorne
Hoppers</span> and Captain <span class="smcap">Mashington</span> are coming to play tennis on
Sunday! Of course, I shall show absolute indifference. I wired at
once to town for my new dress. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hopper</span> may as well see it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Beaumont</span> is always changing his clothes, and has two
button-holes sent down from London daily. He says he "intends to
revive the gardenia."... <span class="smcap">Oriel</span> has just gone out for a "<i>brisk
walk before dinner</i>." Aren't we <i>utterly</i> unsuited to each other?</p>

<p class="center">
Your loving friend,<span class="smcap author">Gladys</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;<i>Is</i> the moon mineral?</p>

<h2>THE GENERAL LITERARY REVIEW COMPANY, LIMITED.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Capital</span> £100,000,000, <span class="smcap">in</span> 20,000,000 <span class="smcap">Shares of</span> £5 <span class="smcap">each</span>.</p>

<div class="figright w25">

</div>

<p>This Company has been formed to acquire, combine into one, and
carry on the various old-established businesses of literary reviewing
hitherto carried on separately by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Andrew Lang</span> (who will
join the Board after allotment), <span class="smcap">Grant Allen</span>, <span class="smcap">W. E. Gladstone</span>,
<span class="smcap">H. D. Traill</span>, <span class="smcap">T. P. O'Connor</span>, <span class="smcap">Walter Besant</span>, <span class="smcap">Elkin
Mathews</span>, <span class="smcap">John Lane</span>, <span class="smcap">Q.</span>, <span class="smcap">A.T.Q.C.</span>, <span class="smcap">Quiller Couch</span>, <span class="smcap">Richard
Le Gallienne</span>, and others. All these gentlemen have consented to act
as Directors. The advantages of the scheme
are obvious. Hitherto critical opinion, as
printed in the daily, weekly, and monthly
press, has been so diversified as to make it
impossible for the public to form a settled
judgment on books. For instance, a work
may be described in one place as "possessing
in the highest degree the master qualities
of brilliant humour and profound
pathos"; while, in another notice, published
on the same day, it may be condemned
as "an essay in stupid buffoonery,
which mistakes inversion for paradox, and
makes a parade of sentiment as laughable
as its efforts at humour are melancholy."
It is the intention of the Directors to
change all this. Frequent Board-Meetings will be held, at which all
books sent for review will be carefully considered, with a view to
deciding how they shall be treated. The decisions thus come to will
be carried out in a series of articles extending with absolute uniformity
over the whole field of contemporary literature.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Profits.</span></p>

<p>The profits of the business to be thus carried on must be gigantic.
After a careful inspection of the books of all British newspapers the
well-known accountants Messrs. <span class="smcap">Leger and Ballance</span> have informed
the Directors that the gains of these papers <i>from reviewing
and literary gossip alone</i> amount to £10,632,009 12<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> annually. As
these papers will henceforth, on their literary side, be worked by the
Directors with all the latest improvements, even larger gains may be
looked for in the immediate future.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Booming.</span></p>

<p>This department will be managed by a paragraphist of unrivalled
experience, who will have under his orders a large staff of skilled
assistants thoroughly instructed in the use of the new patent
mitrailleuse Boomerangs, ten of which will be fixed in the chief office
of the Company at No. 1, Log Rolls Yard. Literary shareholders to
the amount of £500 and upwards will be entitled to a preferential
boom by way of bonus.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bludgeon Work.</span></p>

<p>For this style of reviewing a separate department has been established,
under the joint management of three well-known literary
failures, Messrs. <span class="smcap">Scribley</span>, <span class="smcap">Fibley And Glibley</span>. By a careful
imitation of the worst models, and by assiduously cultivating their
own natural coarseness, the managers anticipate very remarkable
results. Style will be no object, but every worker in this department
will be expected to provide his own rhinoceros hide and stock of
allusions to <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span>. All holders of less than three shares will come
under the operation of this department. The Company intend shortly,
however, to issue £10 debentures, the owners of which will be permitted
once a year to ballot for the privilege of reviewing the book of
one of their friends.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Insurance Scheme.</span></p>

<p>The Directors propose to organise a scheme of insurance against
hostile reviews and obdurate editors. For an annual payment of £24
an insurer will be entitled to one favourable review during the year;
for £30 he will be absolutely guaranteed against unfavourable
criticism. A small yearly payment, varying according to age, will entitle
his widow to claim £1000 at his death upon furnishing a certificate,
signed by Mr. <span class="smcap">Besant</span> and the family doctor, that he died after
reading an unfavourable notice of one of his books. All literary men,
however, are recommended to subscribe £30 a year, thus obtaining a
life-long immunity from depreciation.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Female Branch.</span></p>

<p>This will be known as the "George Department," and will be controlled
by four new women of advanced views. Cigarettes, latch-keys,
and a summary of divorce court proceedings will be kept on the
premises. Novels turned out while you wait. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lynn Linton</span>
will not be admitted during office hours.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Something New in the Drama</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr. Henry Irving</span>, it appears,
has made a great hit in a one-part piece written by Dr. <span class="smcap">Conan
Doyle</span>, entitled <i>A Story of Waterloo</i>. Probably Mr. <span class="smcap">J. L. Toole</span>
will follow it up with <i>A Story of Brandy-and-Waterloo</i>, in which
our cheerful comedian will appear as a regular Wetter'un.</p>
